# About

Pinned ProtonMail is a simple browser extenstion that opens a new [ProtonMail](https://mail.protonmail.com) tab or switches to it if it's already open.

This extension is based on [@abrizuela](https://github.com/abrizuela)'s Firefox extensions for pinned services.

## Installation

Although Pinned ProtonMail is working both in Firefox and Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Brave, Opera, Vivaldi, etc) it can't be found in Chrome Web Store at the moment. However, you can download it from [Firefox Addons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pinned-protonmail/).
